Essential:
1. Motor for opening door both ways
2. Camera, motion sensor and ultrasonic ranger to detect people
3. Display to tell what the guests/owner to do
4. Wireless dongle to communicate with phone
(need to find out how to always be connected to the door even at long distances)
5. Button for actual doorbell ringing
6. Second button to allow manual user exit
7. Buzzer for alarm/informing user someone is at the door
8. Raspberry pi to store face ids

Optional:
1. Temperature sensor to sense surroundings
(for adjusting components - no idea how to do that)
2. Light sensor to detect time of day
(maybe adjusting camera when needed - will need to investigate more)
